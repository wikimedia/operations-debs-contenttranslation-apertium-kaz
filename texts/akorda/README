Instructions for Ubuntu on downloading news articles from akorda.kz in HTML (!)

1. Install HTML::LinkExtractor module from CPAN

sudo apt-get install cpanminus
sudo cpanm HTML::LinkExtractor


2. Download links.pl script and then get the links to news in English from akorda.kz

./links.pl > links.en

(takes a while)

3. Obtain links to news in Kazakh by changing 'en' to 'kz'

cat links.en | sed -E 's/php\/en\/page/php\/kz\/page/g' > links.kz


4. Create separate folders for Kazakh and English, and move links there

mkdir kz
mkdir en
mv links.kz kz
mv links.en en


5. Now download news-articles in each language

cd kz
wget -i links.kz

cd ../en
wget -i links.en


6. Now you can extract content of the articles in plain text using extract_text.pl script, but this is the step, where I think better processing techniques should be applied (like STRAND) before stripping HTML.
